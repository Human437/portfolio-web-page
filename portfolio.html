            This project was inspired by
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home">The Odin Project</a>.
            This is a basic calculator app that incorporates PEMDAS. In addition
            to the basic functions of a calculator, it has a backspace button,
            an all-clear button, and a previous answer button. The project is
            nothing crazy, but it taught me the basics of combining HTML, CSS,
            JS. Check out the
            <a href="https://github.com/Human437/Calculator">repo</a> or view

            This project was inspired by

            The goal was to replicate an Etch a Sketch board by using HTML, CSS,
            and JS. This was a great project to learn about the basics of
            dom-manipulation and the basics of event listeners. Check out the

          >
          <p>
            An app that allows users to get the most recent number of Covid-19
            cases, deaths, and recovered at the global, country, and state
            level. Users also can perform a self-test to better determine if
            they need to get an in-person PCR test. A page on some of the things
            they can do to keep themselves and those around them from Covid-19
            has also been provided. This app was built with HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, and JQuery. Check out the

          <a href="https://noteful-tau-woad.vercel.app/"><h3>Noteful</h3></a>
          <p>
            An app that allows users to group their notes into folders, view
            them all at once, or individually view each note in more detail. The
            selected folder is highlighted so that users can more easily
            distinguish what the currently active folder is. This is my first
            full-stack project and does not make use of account-specific
            information. This app was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React,
            Express, and Postgres. Check out the
            <a href="https://github.com/Human437/noteful">repo</a> or view the

          <h3>Credit Card Recommender</h3>
          <p>
            An app designed to help people who are new to the credit card game
            decide on their first five credit cards based on key factors like
            their credit score and their last hard inquiry. Often there is too
            much information about credit cards, which can seem daunting to new
            users. This tool aims to be a one-stop-shop providing quick and easy
            recommendations. This app was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            React, Express, and Postgres. Check out the
